PROJECT DOCUMENTATION : 

Architectural Pattern that was used for this project is MVVM (Model–view–viewmodel). It is a pattern where frontend and backend are developed separately , and connected together through viewmodel. We used this pattern because it makes our backend and frontend indepentent , which allow us to reuse them on different projects independently.


Main Design Pattern that was used for this project is SPA (Single page application)/ A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. 

Secondary Desing Pattern used for this project is State Design Pattern. It is a pattern which allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is used bacause of React.js on frontend which is super responsive with internal state changes.
